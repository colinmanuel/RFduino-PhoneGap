# RFduino Motor Control

This is a small project to control 12v motors using the [RFduino](http://rfduino.com/ "RFduino") and Don Coleman's [RFduino Plugin for PhoneGap](https://github.com/don/cordova-plugin-rfduino/ "RFduino Plugin for PhoneGap"). 

The project goal is to control the speed and direction of a 12v motor using an iPhone's Bluetooth connection. The initial prototype will control LED color and brightness as a proxy for motor control using a motor driver.

### TODO:
-  ~~Communicate with RFduino~~
-  ~~Toggle 1 output correctly (Blue LED)~~
-  ~~Drive and stop motor~~
-  ~~Toggle 2 outputs correctly (Blue and Green LED)~~
- Add PWN control to one output (Blue LED)
- Add PWN control to two outputs (Blue and Green LED)
- Drive, stop and reverse motor
- Control motor with variable speed in both directions
- Send motor state data from RFduino to iPhone
- Redesign iPhone interface / remove JQM
- Automatically select closest BLE signal
